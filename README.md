Faculty Project - Course Scheduler
This is a project for our faculty to schedule courses for the upcoming academic year. The goal of the project is to provide a user-friendly interface for faculty members to submit their course preferences, and for the administration to schedule courses based on those preferences.

Features
Faculty members can create an account, log in, and submit their course preferences for the upcoming academic year.
The administration can view faculty course preferences and use that information to create a course schedule for the upcoming academic year.
The system can generate a printable schedule that can be shared with faculty members and students.
